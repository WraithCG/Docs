# What’s New in Project v1.0

This release integrates several standalone systems into a cohesive package and introduces significant quality-of-life improvements.

## Integrated Systems
We have pre-integrated three major systems to work seamlessly together:
1.  **CharacterSelectionSystem V1.2**
2.  **CharacterCustomizationSystem V1.1**
3.  **WidgetsManagementSystem V1.1**

## Key Features

### Animation
* **Character Animation Modification System:** A new system giving you micro-control over animations. You can now modify existing animations to create unique character behaviors without external tools.

### Camera System
The camera system has received a major overhaul:
* **Improved Blending:** Transitions between camera states are smoother.
* **Settings Toggle:** Added a toggle in the main menu to control camera settings.
* **Customization Cameras:** Unique camera animations play during character customization based on the specific category being edited.
* **New Camera Modes:** Added specific camera behaviors for Normal movement, Crouching, and Sprinting, including lean (left/right) variations for all states.

### User Interface (UI)
* **Revamped Layouts:** Menu layouts have been redesigned for better usability.
* **Pause Menu:** A fully functional pause menu has been added.
* **Background Sequences:** You can now play Level Sequences in the background of widget screens for a more dynamic UI experience.

### Gameplay Elements
* **Death Box:** A trigger volume that instantly kills the player upon overlap. 
    * *Note:* There is no respawn system. The character ragdolls (based on the `UEFN_Mannequin` physics asset), and you must restart the level via the main menu to respawn.
* **Improved Emotes:** The emoting system logic has been refined for better reliability.

## The Two Mannequins: A Technical Note
You will notice two mannequins in the project files. It is crucial to understand the difference:

1.  **UEFN_Mannequin (White):** This is the "Master" asset containing the motion matching database and logic. **Do not modify this mesh directly** (e.g., adding/removing sockets) while the game is running or if you want to avoid editor freezes, as it forces a database update.
2.  **NewUEFN_Mannequin (Orange):** This is the "Gameplay" asset used by the player. It works like any other retargeted character. Use this one for playing the game.
