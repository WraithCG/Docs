# Important Notes & Prerequisites

Before diving into development, please review the following technical requirements and design choices to ensure a smooth workflow.

## 1. Motion Matching & Animations
This project utilizes the **default motion matching setup** provided by the *Game Animation Sample Project (GASP)*. 
* **No Custom Setup:** There is no custom motion matching logic created specifically for this template; it relies on the standard GASP implementation.
* **Animations:** It uses the default animation library included with GASP.

## 2. Game Data & Save System
* **No Persistence:** The project does not utilize a `GameInstance` class for persistent data storage. This means game data is **not saved** between sessions or level transitions.
* **Customization Resets:** Any customization applied to a character will be lost if you switch characters or restart the game.

## 3. Required Plugins
For the project to function correctly, ensure the following plugins are **Enabled** in your project settings:

**Animation & Motion:**
* AnimationWarping
* MotionWarping
* AnimationLocomotionLibrary
* PoseSearch
* Chooser
* RigLogic
* LiveLink & LiveLinkControlRig

**Tools & Physics:**
* ModelingToolsEditorMode
* HairStrands
* Mover
* NetworkPrediction

## 4. Integration Strategy
This project is designed as a **Base Starting Project**. 
* **Not for Migration:** The systems are heavily interface-driven. While modular, it is **not recommended** to migrate this entire project into an existing one. 
* **Alternative:** If you want specific features, you can download the standalone versions of the *CharacterSelectionSystem*, *CharacterCustomizationSystem*, and *WidgetsManagementSystem* from FAB (available for free) and integrate them individually.

## 5. Unreal Engine 5.7 Compatibility
This project is fully compatible with Unreal Engine 5.7. However, please note that the *Game Animation Sample* for 5.7 introduces changes that prevent a direct integration of the Character Selection System used here. A dedicated 5.7 update for this template is coming soon, which will include Mover Component support and other features.
