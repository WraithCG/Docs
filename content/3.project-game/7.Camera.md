# Camera System

The camera system in v1.0 has been overhauled to provide cinematic quality and smoother transitions.

## Camera Director
The `CameraDirector_SandboxCharacter` blueprint handles the logic for switching between different camera states.

### Camera Modes
1.  **Normal Gameplay:** The standard Third-Person perspective.
2.  **Aiming:**
    * The camera attaches to the player character's **Head Bone**.
    * You can adjust the offset (Translation/Rotation) per character inside the `BPC_PlayerAttributesComponent`. This allows for precise aiming setups regardless of character height.
3.  **Rigs:**
    * The system uses specific **Camera Rigs** triggered by gameplay actions or menu states.
    * *Examples:* There are distinct rigs for Crouching, Sprinting, Death screens, and Main Menus.

## Implementation
The blending logic is handled inside the Event Graph of the Camera Director. It checks the player's state (Crouched, Aiming, Sprinting) and blends to the appropriate Camera Rig defined in the project files.
