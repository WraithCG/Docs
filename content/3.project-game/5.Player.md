# Player Character (CBP_SandboxCharacter)

The `CBP_SandboxCharacter` is the core blueprint for the player. To make it easier to navigate and modify, the blueprint's graphs and actions have been categorized into distinct sections (Movement, Camera, Actions, etc.).

## BPC_PlayerAttributesComponent
This component acts as the "brain" for many player-specific settings. It is extremely powerful and handles the following:

### 1. Décor Data
This data structure determines what information is displayed on the **Character Selection Screen**. It highlights the specific qualities of a character (e.g., Strength, Speed).
* *Modification:* You can edit the `S_Attributes` struct located in `Components > Attributes > Structs` to add or remove fields displayed on the widget.

### 2. Ragdoll Settings
* **Ragdoll on Death:** A boolean setting. If checked, the character will simulate physics (ragdoll) immediately upon overlapping a death trigger box.

### 3. Aiming Offsets
These settings allow you to fine-tune the camera position when the player enters the First-Person Aiming mode.
* **Aim Translation Offset:** Adjusts the position (X, Y, Z).
* **Aim Rotation Offset:** Adjusts the rotation (Pitch, Yaw, Roll).

### 4. Emote System Configuration
This section controls how the character plays emotes within menus or gameplay.
* **Wait Time:** Time delay before the emote animation actually starts after triggering.
* **Blend Out Time:** How long it takes to smoothly stop an emote when interrupted.
* **Min/Max Delay:** A random time range chosen to blend out an emote when switching between different emote sequences.
* **Emote Data Asset:** A reference to a Data Asset (e.g., `DA_EmoteActionData`) that contains the specific emote sequences to play for specific widget screens.

### 5. Debugging
* **Debug Sequence Index:** Prints the index of the currently playing emote sequence to the log.
* **Debug Anim Montage:** Prints the name of the active emote montage.

## Emote Data Asset Structure
The Emote Data Asset maps specific widgets to animation sequences.

* **Abort Previous:** If checked, switching screens will abruptly stop the current emote to start the new one. If unchecked, the current emote finishes first.
    * If the previous emote sequence is not aborted, then the emote sequence related to previous widget screen is completed first and then the new emote sequence is used.
* **Animation Montages:** Contain the Montage Sequences.
    * If the previous em
* **PlaySequentially:**
    * *True:* Plays montages in the exact order defined (e.g., Stand Up -> Wave -> Sit Down).
    * *False:* Randomly selects montages from the list to play, switching to a new random one upon completion.
* When one sequence is complete, then another animationMontages data is searched and selected for playing if available.
